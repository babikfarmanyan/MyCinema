      "overview": "The play “Wedding in the Rear” has been filmed, which means that right now in the online cinema ARMFilm.co you can watch the film of the same name. The picture tells about the events that took place in the zone of the Karabakh conflict. The April war, which lasted 4 days, became a difficult test for many people. The film 'Wedding in the Rear' is presented in an unusual format, because it is both a feature film and a performance. The plot is based on real events. April 2, 2016 is the start date of the four-day war. And it was on this day that the wedding took place, the participants of which were ordinary Armenians. During the celebration, 19-year-old residents were killed on the border, but in Gyumri, where the wedding was being played at that moment, no one knew about these tragic events. Death and the birth of a new family are antagonistic events, which is another proof of the expression 'woe and joy are always there.'' Watch this film that will make you empathize and allow you to experience many different emotions. All views in our online cinema are free. The complete absence of advertising is an added advantage.",
